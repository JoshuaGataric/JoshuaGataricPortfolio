Hi! I'm Joshua Gataric, currently pursuing a Master of Data Science at UCI. I have a keen interest in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and exploratory data analysis.
My role as a supplemental instruction leader at San Diego State ignited my curiosity and passion for statistics.
Additionally, undergraduate coursework such as Ling 583 Statistical Methods in Text Analysis and STAT 410 R Programming and Data Science 
has deepened my enthusiasm for the field of data science.

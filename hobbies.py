# Madden subsection

st.write("""
Football has always been my favorite sport. Although I never had the chance to play it in real life, I've been fascinated with the video game series "Madden." Playing Madden has let me feel the competitive side of football, and I've even traveled across the country to compete in tournaments. During my undergrad, I also represented San Diego State in the LevelNext Madden National Championship each year.

Since my parents got a Jeep, off-roading and hiking have become a bonding activity for me and my dad. We've explored breathtaking sights and conquered various trails throughout San Diego. One of my favorite trails is Pio Pico in Jamul, with its many offshoots for exploring!

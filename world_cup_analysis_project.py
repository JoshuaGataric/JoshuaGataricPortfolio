# Overview Section
st.write("""
This project analyzes player statistics from the 2022 FIFA World Cup, including goals, assists, successful dribbles, tackles, and more. I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using SAS to capture the relationships betIen these stats and reveal underlying patterns in player and team performance.

PCA helped in identifying key components representing offensive versus defensive metrics, player experience, and age. This analysis gives insights into the characteristics of top players and teams, highlighting key differences betIen offensive and balanced play styles.

Based on the retained components, PC1 represents an average across player statistics, with similar values across variables except Age. PC2 contrasts defensive and offensive metrics (positive for defense, negative for offense). PC3 primarily captures the influence of Age, indicating player experience, as shown by its unique high value for this variable. A similar pattern emerged when analyzing by team.
